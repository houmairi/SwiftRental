## Detailed Description of Task Packages

### 1. Project Initialization
The foundational setup of the development environment and technology stack selection. This package focused on establishing the project structure and core dependencies.

**Completed Tasks:**
- Next.js project creation with TypeScript integration
- ESLint and development tools configuration
- Git repository initialization
- Package dependencies installation (React, TailwindCSS)
- Project structure organization

**Technical Decisions:**
- Next.js selected for full-stack capabilities
- TypeScript chosen for type safety and improved development experience
- React 19 utilized for modern component architecture
- TailwindCSS implemented for utility-first styling approach

### 2. Database Structuring
The design and implementation of the database schema, focusing on normalization principles and scalability considerations.

**Completed Tasks:**
- Database schema design with normalization
- Entity relationship modeling
- Prisma schema definition for all core models (Customer, Car, Rental)
- Docker configuration for PostgreSQL
- Database migration script creation

**Technical Decisions:**
- PostgreSQL selected for advanced querying capabilities
- Prisma ORM chosen for type-safe database operations
- Normalized schema design to prevent redundancy
- Docker containerization for consistent development environment

### 3. Infrastructure Configuration
The setup of application infrastructure components, including API structure, utility functions, and core services.

**Completed Tasks:**
- Prisma client singleton implementation
- API route structure setup
- Environment variable configuration
- Utility function creation
- Shadcn UI component integration

**Technical Decisions:**
- Singleton pattern for database client to prevent connection exhaustion
